# Crypto Intelligence Dashboard (Next.js + Playwright E2E Testing)

A modern cryptocurrency dashboard built with Next.js, showcasing real-time data visualization and a production-like end-to-end testing setup using Playwright.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time crypto data from CoinCap API v3
- Mock data mode for offline use and deployments without an API key
- Interactive historical charts (24H, 7D, 30D, 90D)
- Smart search and filtering (by name or symbol)
- Sort by market cap, price, or 24H change
- Trade journal with per-coin notes
- Price alerts with email and persistence
- Watchlist with localStorage persistence
- Responsive dark UI

## 📡 Data Sources

### CoinCap API v3

This project uses the [CoinCap REST API v3](https://rest.coincap.io) to fetch live market data.

**Base URL:** `https://rest.coincap.io/v3`  
**Authentication:** Bearer token (API key required)

#### Getting an API key

1. Visit [rest.coincap.io](https://rest.coincap.io) and create an account
2. Generate an API key from your dashboard
3. Copy the key — it is a long hex string

#### Configuring the key locally

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root (it is git-ignored):

```bash
COINCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Restart the dev server after adding the key. The app detects the key at startup; no code change is needed.

#### Endpoints used

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /v3/assets?limit=20` | Top 20 coins by market cap |
| `GET /v3/assets/{slug}/history` | OHLCV history for a coin |

### Mock data mode

When `COINCAP_API_KEY` is **not set**, the app serves deterministic mock data for all 20 CoinCap top-20 coins with realistic base prices. No network call is made to CoinCap.

When the key **is** set, a **"Mock data / Live data"** toggle button appears in the filter bar. Clicking it adds `?mockData=1` to the URL and forces all fetches through the mock layer. Clicking again removes it and restores live data.

Mock data reflects the top-20 snapshot at the time of the last code update. It is in `src/features/crypto/server/mockCryptoData.ts`.

## 🎯 Why Playwright

This project was built to explore modern end-to-end testing approaches using Playwright, focusing on reliability, speed, and maintainability compared to traditional frameworks.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

This project emphasizes test reliability and maintainability:

- **End-to-End Testing with Playwright**
- **Page Object Model (POM)** for scalable test structure
- **API route mocking** for deterministic, offline-safe test results
- **Behavior-based test separation** (data, search, error, interactions, data-source)
- **`data-testid` selectors** for stable UI targeting
- **CI integration with GitHub Actions**
- **Automated HTML reports published via GitHub Pages**

## 🤖 AI-assisted Development

AI tools were used to support test case generation, code review, and test validation, improving development speed and overall testing efficiency.

### ▶️ Run Application

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 🧪 Run Tests

```bash
# Mock mode (default) — no API key needed, works offline and in CI
npm run test:e2e

# Live mode — requires COINCAP_API_KEY to be set in the environment
npm run test:e2e:live

# Interactive Playwright UI — mock mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### 📊 Open Report
